### Topic
Visualizing the consumer complaints from the Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection (CFPB)    

### Motivation
The purpose of this project is to develop a web application that allows users to quickly explore the Consumer Complaint Database through visualizations. The tool would serve as a starting point for exploratory analysis into this dataset. We have made the raw data available to download for everyone who comes across this tool. Some of the questions that can be answered using this web application include:

1. Which states receive the highest number of consumer complaints?    
2. What are the most frequent terms associated with complaints?    
3. Do the sentiments expressed differ by financial product?    
4. Have the trends in consumer complaints changed following COVID?    
5. Which companies receive the most amount of complaints?    

### Data Descriptions

Description: 
The Consumer Complaint Database is a collection of complaints about consumer financial products and services that we sent to companies for response. Complaints are published after the company responds, confirming a commercial relationship with the consumer, or after 15 days, whichever comes first. Complaints referred to other regulators, such as complaints about depository institutions with less than $10 billion in assets, are not published in the Consumer Complaint Database. The database generally updates daily. Each row in this data set corresponds to a complaint that was given by a customer and the related attributes such as a narrative, issue and sub-issue type, related financial product, etc.
